## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cheat-sheet-generator.git
   cd cheat-sheet-generator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Cohere API key and other environment variables:
   - Add your **Cohere API key** and your **Groq API Key** to a `.env` file:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key
     COHERE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## **Usage**

1. **Input a Topic**: Provide the topic or query for which you need a cheat sheet.
2. **Select Output Preferences**: Choose the format (e.g., bullet points, table) and level of detail.
3. **Generate**: The tool will retrieve relevant information, process it, and generate a cheat sheet tailored to your needs.

## **Examples**

### **Input**
```
Generate a cheat sheet on the topic: "Quantum Computing Basics."
```

### **Output**
```markdown
# Quantum Computing Basics

- **Qubits**: Fundamental units of quantum information.
- **Superposition**: A qubit can represent multiple states simultaneously.
- **Entanglement**: Qubits share a connection, allowing state changes to correlate.
- **Applications**:
  - Cryptography
  - Machine learning
  - Complex simulations
```
